1. `Reduce` function is used at a place where we we take all the elements inside the collection and come up with a single value out of it.

Syntax :-

let result = array.reduce(function (accumulator,current){write logic}, 0)

Here 0 represents the initial value of the accumulator. It can be array or Objects as well.
`Current` -> Basically points to the current element of the array.
`Accumulator` -> The final result what we need to get out of the array.
